Keras is the interface for the TensorFlow library. Use Keras on the off chance that you need a profound learning library that allows simple and quick prototyping (through ease of use, seclusion, and extensibility). Support both convolutional networks and repetitive organizations, just as blends of the two. Run flawlessly on CPU and GPU.
